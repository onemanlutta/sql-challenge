As a newly hired data engineer at Pewlett Hackard (fictional company), I research about the people the company employeed during the 1980s and 1990s in my second week of employment. This information is available in six CSV files. I apply data modelling, data engineering and, data analysis skills to respond to the needs at hand for the business.
